# Bellabeat Wellness Analysis  

## Overview  
This project is part of the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone**.  

The objective is to analyze **Bellabeat‚Äôs wellness data** to understand user patterns in activity, sleep, weight, and heart rate. These insights are then used to recommend strategies that can enhance user engagement and support Bellabeat‚Äôs growth as a holistic wellness brand.

- Identifying behavioral patterns in activity, sleep, and health metrics.  
- Understanding differences between highly active and less active users.  
- Supporting recommendations with visual evidence and measurable insights.

## Process  
The analysis followed the **six-step data analysis framework**:  

1. **Ask** ‚Äì Define the problem: ‚ÄúHow do Bellabeat users engage with their wellness data across activity, sleep, and health?‚Äù  
2. **Prepare** ‚Äì Collect and merge daily activity, sleep, weight, and heart rate datasets.  
3. **Process** ‚Äì Clean data (remove duplicates, fix missing values, standardize formats).  
4. **Analyze** ‚Äì Explore trends in steps, calories, sleep duration, BMI, and heart rate.  
5. **Share** ‚Äì Create clear visualizations and summaries to communicate patterns.  
6. **Act** ‚Äì Suggest strategies to improve user engagement and product positioning.

## Key Insights  
- **Activity**: Highly active users walk ~13,000 steps daily vs. ~2,500 for less active users. More steps strongly correlate with more calories burned (r = 0.56).  
- **Sedentary Patterns**: Sitting time is highest on Mondays and Fridays, and lowest on Tuesdays, showing clear weekday effects.  
- **Sleep**: Average sleep is 7.2 hours with high quality (91% efficiency). Users sleep more on weekends and less on workdays.  
- **Weight & BMI**: Average BMI is 25.4 (borderline healthy). About 64% of users log weight manually, showing proactive health tracking.  
- **Heart Rate**: Average daily heart rate is 79 bpm. Ranges show both casual and fitness-focused users.  
- **Activity vs Sleep**: Slight negative correlation (r = -0.28) ‚Äî more activity does not always mean more sleep.

## üìä Sample Visualizations  

Here are a few key visualizations generated during the analysis:  

**Visualization 1: Steps vs Calories Burned**  
This scatter plot shows a clear positive relationship between **daily steps** and **calories burned**, indicating that more active users burn more calories.

## Recommendations  
1. Launch **weekday activity challenges** to counter high sedentary time.  
2. Promote **Bellabeat as a sleep and stress management guide** alongside activity tracking.  
3. Introduce **auto-weight logging features** to reduce manual effort.  
4. Position Bellabeat as a **holistic wellness brand** focusing on activity, sleep, heart, and weight tracking.
